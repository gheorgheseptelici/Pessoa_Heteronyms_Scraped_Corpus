Alvaro de Campos,Lisbon Revisited (1926),"Nothing holds me. I want fifty things at the same time. I long with meat-craving anxiety For I don’t know what— Definitely something indefinite … I sleep fitfully and live in the fitful dream-state Of a fitful sleeper, half dreaming. All abstract and necessary doors were closed in my face. Curtains were drawn across every hypothesis I could have seen from the street. I found the alley but not the number of the address I was given. I woke up to the same life Iʾd fallen asleep to. Even the armies I dreamed of were defeated. Even my dreams felt false while I dreamed them. Even the life I merely long for jades me—even that life … At intermittent intervals I understand; I write in respites from my weariness; And a boredom bored even of itself casts me ashore. I donʾt know what destiny or future belongs to my anxiety adrift on the waves; I donʾt know what impossible South Sea islands await me, a castaway, Or what palm groves of literature will grant me at least a verse. No, I don’t know this, or that, or anything else... And in the depths of my spirit, where I dream all I’ve dreamed, In my soul’s far-flung fields, where I remember for no reason (And the past is a natural fog of false tears), On the roads and pathways of distant forests Where I supposed my being dwelled— There my dreamed armies, defeated without having been, And my nonexistent legions, annihilated in God, All flee in disarray, the last remnants Of the final illusion. Once more I see you, City of my horrifyingly lost childhood … Happy and sad city, once more I dream here … I? Is it one and the same I who lived here, and came back, And came back again, and again, And yet again have come back? Or are we—all the Iʾs that I was here or that were here— A series of bead-beings joined together by a string of memory, A series of dreams about me dreamed by someone outside me? Once more I see you, With a heart thatʾs more distant, a soul thatʾs less mine. Once more I see you—Lisbon, the Tagus and the rest— A useless onlooker of you and of myself, A foreigner here like everywhere else, Incidental in life as in my soul, A ghost wandering through halls of remembrances To the sound of rats and creaking floorboards In the accursed castle of having to live … Once more I see you, A shadow moving among shadows, gleaming For an instant in some bleak unknown light Before passing into the night like a shipʾs wake swallowed In water whose sound fades into silence … Once, more I see you, But, oh, I cannot see myself! The magic mirror where I always looked the same has shattered, And in each fateful fragment I see only a piece of me— A piece of you and of me! 26 April 1926 PESSOA, Fernando , A Little Larger Than the Entire Universe: Selected Poems , Edited and Translated by Richard Zenith.

Alvaro de Campos,Ah the sound of the maid’s iron passing back and forth,"Ah the sound of the maid's iron passing back and forth At the window next to where my childhood leaned out! The sound of laundry being washed in the tank! All these things are, in some way or other, Part of what I am. (O dead nanny, what's become of your gray-haired affection?) My childhood barely poking its head over the table... My chubby hand on the edge of the tablecloth that curled... And Iʾd stand on tiptoe to see across my plate. Today it's only intellectually that I'm ever on tiptoe. And my table has no tablecloth, and nobody to put one on it. Iʾve studied the grammar of failure In the demonology of the imagination.

Alvaro de Campos,"Ah, open my eyes to another reality!","Ah, open my eyes to another reality! I want to feel, like Blake, the angels all around me And to have visions for lunch. I want to meet fairies in the street! I want to forget I’m of this world made with claws, This civilization made with nails. I want to live like a flag in the breeze, A symbol of whatever on top of wherever! Then you can lock me up where you like. My true heart will continue to keep watch From atop the flagpole of visions, A cloth emblazoned with sphinxes Flapping in the four winds of Mystery: The North ­— what everyone wants, The South — what everyone desires, The East — where everything comes from, The West — where everything ends. The four winds of civilization’s mystical air... The four ways of not knowing, and of understanding the world... 4 April 1929 PESSOA, Fernando , Forever Someone Else: selected poems , translated by Richard Zenith.

Alvaro de Campos,Ah Margarida,"Ah Margarida, If I gave you my life, What would you do with it? I’d take my earrings out of hock, Marry a blind man, And live on a tree-lined block. But Margarida, If I gave you my life, What would your mother say? (Her mother knows me inside out.) She’d say you’re a fool, Without a doubt. And Margarida, If I gave you my life Literally, by dying? I’d go to your funeral, firmly believing You’d gone mad To try to love by not living. But Margarida, If this giving of my life to you Were merely poetry?​​​​​​​ In that case, forget it, The deal’s off, Because I don’t sell on credit. Dictated by the Naval Engineer Sr. Álvaro de Campos in a state of alcoholic unconsciousness. 1 October 1927 ZENITH, Richard (2019)"
Alberto Caeiro,Iʾm a keeper of sheep,"IX Iʾm a keeper of sheep. The sheep are my thoughts And each thought a sensation. I think with my eyes and my ears And with my hands and feet And with my nose and mouth. To think a flower is to see and smell it, And to eat a fruit is to know its meaning. That is why on a hot day When I enjoy it so much I feel sad, And I lie down in the grass And close my warm eyes, Then I feel my whole body lying down in reality, I know the truth, and Iʾm happy.

Alberto Caeiro,My gaze is clear like a sunflower,"From The Keeper Of Sheep II My gaze is clear like a sunflower. It is my custom to walk the roads Looking right and left And sometimes looking behind me, And what I see at each moment Is what I never saw before, And Iʾm very good at noticing things. Iʾm capable of feeling the same wonder A newborn child would feel If he noticed that heʾd really and truly been born. I feel at each moment that Iʾve just been born Into a completely new world … I believe in the world as in a daisy, Because I see it. But I donʾt think about it, Because to think is to not understand. The world wasnʾt made for us to think about it (To think is to have eyes that arenʾt well) But to look at it and to be in agreement. I have no philosophy, I have senses… If I speak of Nature itʾs not because I know what it is But because I love it, and for that very reason, Because those who love never know what they love Or why they love, or what love is. To love is eternal innocence, And the only innocence is not to think… 8 Marc 1914 PESSOA, Fernando , A Little Larger Than the Entire Universe: Selected Poems , Edited and Translated by Richard Zenith.

Alberto Caeiro,The Tagus is more beautiful than the river that flows through my village,"20 The Tagus is more beautiful than the river that flows through my village, But the Tagus is not more beautiful than the river that flows through my village Because the Tagus is not the river that flows through my village. The Tagus has enormous ships, And for those who see in everything that which isnʾt there Its waters are still sailed By the memory of the carracks. The Tagus descends from Spain And crosses Portugal to pour into the sea. Everyone knows this. But few know what the river of my village is called And where it goes to And where it comes from. And so, because it belongs to fewer people, The river of my village is freer and larger. The Tagus leads to the world. Beyond the Tagus there is America And the fortune of those who find it. No one ever thought about whatʾs beyond The river of my village. The river of my village doesnʾt make one think of anything. Whoever is next to it is simply next to it.

Alberto Caeiro,If I could sink my teeth into the whole earth,"XXI If I could sink my teeth into the whole earth And actually taste it, Iʾd be happier for a moment… But I donʾt always want to be happy. To be unhappy now and then Is part of being natural. Not all days are sunny, And when rain is scarce, we pray for it. And so I take unhappiness with happiness Naturally, just as I donʾt marvel That there are mountains and plains And that there are rocks and grass… What matters is to be natural and calm In happiness and in unhappiness, To feel as if feeling were seeing, To think as if thinking were walking, And to remember, when death comes, that each day dies, And the sunset is beautiful, and so is the night that remains… Thatʾs how it is and how I want it to be … 7 March 1914 PESSOA, Fernando , A Little Larger Than the Entire Universe: Selected Poems , Edited and Translated by Richard Zenith.

Alberto Caeiro,Before I Had You,"from The Shepherd in Love Before I had you I loved Nature as a calm monk loves Christ. Now I love Nature As a calm monk loves the Virgin Mary, Religiously (in my manner), like before, But in a more heartfelt and intimate way. I see the rivers better when I walk with you Through the fields to the riversʾ banks. When I sit next to you and watch the clouds I take better notice of them. You havenʾt taken Nature from me, You havenʾt changed Nature. Youʾve brought Nature closer. Because you exist I see it better, though the same as before. Because you love me I love it in the same way, but more. Because you chose me to have you and love you My eyes attentively gaze at it Above all things. I donʾt regret what I was before. For I am still what I was. I only regret not having loved you before. 6-VI-1914 PESSOA, Fernando , Forever Someone Else: selected poems , translated by Richard Zenith.

Ricardo Reis,I love the roses of Adonis’s gardens,"I love the roses of Adonisʾs gardens. Yes, Lydia, I love those wingèd roses, Which one day are born And on that day die. Light for them is eternal, since They are born after sunrise and end Before Apollo quits His visible journey. Let us also make our lives one day, Consciously forgetting thereʾs night, Lydia, Before and after The little we endure 11 July 1914 PESSOA, Fernando , A Little Larger Than the Entire Universe: Selected Poems , Edited and Translated by Richard Zenith.

Ricardo Reis,"Come sit with me, Lydia, next to the river","Come sit with me, Lydia, next to the river. Let’s quietly watch it flow and learn How life passes, and we’re not holding hands. (Let’s hold hands.) Grown-up children, let’s remember that nothing Remains or returns, life always passes, Going to a far-off sea, close to Destiny, Beyond the gods. Let’s stop holding hands, so as not to grow weary. With or without pleasure, we’ll pass like the river. Better to know how to pass silently, Without commotion. Without loves, hatreds or passions that shout out, Or envies that make eyes flash, or worries, Since even with worries the river would still flow And still empty into the sea. Let’s love gently, knowing that, if we wanted, We could exchange kisses, hugs and caresses But that it’s better to sit next to each other Seeing and hearing the river flow. Place in your lap the flowers we pick, Letting their fragrance sweeten the moment — This moment when, innocent pagans of decadence, We serenely believe in nothing. If I become a shade before you, your memory of me At least won’t burn or hurt or unsettle you, Since we never hold hands or kiss each other And were never more than children. And if you’re the first to give the gloomy boatman his obol, I’ll remember you with no cause for suffering. You, in my memory, will be gentle as now, next to the river, A sad pagan with flowers in her lap. ZENITH, Richard (2019)"
Ricardo Reis,Countless lives inhabit us,"Countless lives inhabit us. I donʾt know, when I think or feel, Who is thinking or feeling. I am merely the place Where things are thought or felt. I have more than just one soul. There are more Iʾs than I myself. I exist, nevertheless, Indifferent to them all. I silence them: I speak. The crossing urges of what I feel or do not feel Struggle in who I am, but I Ignore them. They dictate nothing To the I I know: I write. 13-XI-1935 PESSOA, Fernando , Forever Someone Else: selected poems , translated by Richard Zenith. Lisboa: Assírio & Alvim, 2013, p. 133"
